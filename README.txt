       and same date as search entered, with departure times within 
       the timeDifference part of the search 
   - No GUI created

Multi-Threaded Search Engine 
   Software Development project
   - Purpose: a Java application that crawls a specified seed 
     web page, builds an inverted index, and starts a search 
     engine for a website that provides weighed partial search 
     capability. 
     
     Functional features:
     - Search: displays a webpage with a text box where users
